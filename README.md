# Plasma_Flame_Radio


This personal project was my deepest step into RF circuits to date and pushed me to buy an oscilloscope and a vector network analyzer (VNA).

## Part 1: Plasma Flame

My inspiriation from some youtube videos I've watched which show off flashy and dangerous plasma.  
It is a less deadly and budget friendly version of Styropyro's "fire death machine": https://youtu.be/UNisqZOAaAs?si=NMkZ1_NP11LKSfkR&t=481  
The main 10MHz oscillator uses a similar circuit to the "plasma toroid circuit"

## Part 2: 100W+ AM radio transmitter

Using this circuit, I was able to transmit music as AM radio and listen to it using a handheld shortwave radio reciever.  

this circuit uses an audio amplifier to modulate the supply voltage to the RF amplifier. Below are measurements of the mosfet's drain as I feed a sine wave and a square wave into the "audio in" of the circuit.
